When working with a dynamic poll feature in your app, managing the state of individual options can be tricky. A practical approach is to use an array of objects to represent each poll option. This way, you can easily accommodate any number of options without hardcoding them into your application.

In the example below, a Poll component utilizes React's useState hook to manage the question and options. Initially, a default option is set, but the key is to be able to update the state of a specific option dynamically.
```js
function Poll() {
// State for the poll question
const [question, setQuestion] = useState("");

// State for the poll options, starting with a default option
const [options, setOptions] = useState([
    {
        id: 1,
        value: ""
    }
]);

// Function to update the value of a specific option based on its ID
function updateOption(id, newValue) {
        const updatedOptions = options.map((option) => {
        // Find the option with the matching ID
        if (option.id === id) {
        // Update only the value of the matched option
            return {
                ...option,
                value: newValue
                };
            }

            // Return unchanged options
            return option;
        });

        // Update the state with the modified options
        setOptions(updatedOptions);
    }
}
```
This approach allows for a flexible and scalable solution, accommodating various poll configurations. By using the updateOption function, you can easily modify the value of a specific option based on its unique ID. This method ensures that your app remains adaptable, supporting a dynamic number of poll options without the need for hardcoded values.
