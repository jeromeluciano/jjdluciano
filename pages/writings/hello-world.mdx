Hello and welcome to my first blog! In the future, I aspire to delve deeper into topics related to the technology I'm passionate about and all things web-related. Thank you for stopping by! I hope to see you again soon when I write about the things that bring me joy.

```js 
function printHelloWorld() {
    console.log('hello, world')
}
```

export default ({children}) => <WritingLayout meta={meta}>{children}</WritingLayout>
